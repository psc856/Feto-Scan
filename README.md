# Feto-Scan: Fetal Head Circumference Prediction

Feto-Scan is a machine learning model developed to predict the head circumference of a fetus based on ultrasound images. The model utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net architecture, to perform accurate and reliable predictions, which can assist in prenatal care and early diagnosis.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: (Include any frontend framework or tool you're using, e.g., Flask for web interface)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model**: U-Net (for image segmentation and regression)
- **Others**: OpenCV (for image processing), NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/psc856/Feto-Scan.git
